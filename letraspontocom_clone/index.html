	<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left:100px;">I want you to stay <br>
	Take your eyes off of me so I can leave<br>
	I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me<br>
	This is never ending, we have been here before<br>
	But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore<br>
	Please, stay where you are<br>
	Don't come any closer<br>
	Don't try to change my mind<br>
	I'm being cruel to be kind<br></p>

	I can't love you in the darkI can't love you in the dark<br>
	It feels like we're oceans apart<br>
	There is so much space between us<br>
	Baby, we're already defeated<br>
	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
	Everything changed me<br></p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left:100px;">I want you to stay <br>
	You have given me something that I can't live without<br>
	You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt<br>
	But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine<br>
	The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight<br>
	Please, don't fall apart<br>
	I can't face your breaking heart<br>
	I'm trying to be brave<br>
	Stop asking me to stay<br></p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left:100px;">I want you to stay <br>
	I can't love you in the dark<br>
	It feels like we're oceans apart<br>

	<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left:100px;">I want you to stay <br>
	We're not the only ones<br>
	I don't regret a thing<br>
	Every word I've said<br>
	You know I'll always mean<br>
	It is the world to me<br>
	That you are in my life<br>
	But I want to live<br>
	And not just survive<br></p>

	<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left:100px;">I want you to stay <br>
	That's why I can't love you in the dark<br>
	It feels like we're oceans apart<br>
	There is so much space between us<br>
	Baby, we're already defeated<br>
	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
	Everything changed me<br>
	I, I, I, I, I don't think you can save me<br></p>
